About xprt: 
A Project Management software to merge functionalities of a number of distributed revision control systems (RCSs) such as GIT, Mercurial, Subversion etc. This application will be able to distinguish the type of revision control system a project directory is using. It will be able to update these project directories based on configurations done by the user (programmer, in this case). It will also try to migrate the files to another type of RCS e.g. svn to git etc. when asked for. Also it will be able to do the timely archiving of directories so that older projects can be archived freeing up the space. All in all it is aimed to be a tool for the developer who works on a number of projects using different RCSs.
